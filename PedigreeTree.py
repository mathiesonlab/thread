Pedigree Tree Object: holds pedigree tree data structure constructed from file
of family relationships.

    file format:

    NOTE: any id listed as a father or mother must have its own entry as well
    NOTE: if father and/or mother does not exit in pedigree, input zeroes
    for the id of the missing parent. DO NOT use "0" as the id of any indivudal
    as it is reserved for parents of married-in indivudals.
